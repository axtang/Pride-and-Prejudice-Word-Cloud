# Pride-and-Prejudice-Word-Cloud
A word cloud script for Jane Austen's book, Pride and Prejudice

In this project, I am creating a word cloud from the book Pride and Prejudice. The script processes the text, removes punctuations, ignores case, ignores a set of uninteresting words, and counts the frequencies of the remaining words. It also generates a word cloud image from the word dictionary.
