# Pride-and-Prejudice-Word-Cloud
A word cloud script for Jane Austen's book, Pride and Prejudice

In this project, I am creating a word cloud from the book Pride and Prejudice. The script processes the text, removes punctuations, ignores case, ignores a set of uninteresting words, and counts the frequencies of the remaining words. It also generates a word cloud image from the word dictionary.

The text of Pride and Prejudice is attached to this repo in a file called "prideandprejudice.txt".

This project is part of a Coursera + Google Python Crash Course. I had a lot of fun creating this word cloud script, and I hope you have fun trying your hands on it too.
